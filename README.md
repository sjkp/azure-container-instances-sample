# azure-container-instances-sample
Small sample that shows how to deploy a container from Docker Hub to the Azure Container Instance using an ARM template. 

I also included an Azure Function with a http trigger that makes a deployment of the template, showing how it is possible to combine 
the two services. 

The scenario is just the tutorial web app, provided by Microsoft. But I will update this repository with some more interesting real 
work loads.
